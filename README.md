# Machine-learning-GINs

The aim of the project is to verify a statement that GINs (Graph Isomorphism Networks) are the most powerful graph neural networks. We have trained some architectures of GINs
using the PyTorch framework on the following graph datasets:
* PROTEINS,
* MUTAG,
* PTC_MM,
* ENZYMES,
* DD,
* NCI1.

Then we have compared the results of trained models with the Local Degree Profile method, which is a good and simple baseline. The results are located in the report file. There is also a piece of theory about what GINs and LDP methods are.
